    <description>This Mod adds 4 types of incidents. In these incidents, you are not the protagonist, and you are not at
        the center of the war. You are just a bystander, and you have the right to choose whether to be involved in the
        incident.
        The enemy's AI will have some more detailed performances, such as self-treat, killing enemy wounded, rescuing
        friendly wounded, destroying enemy factions and plundering loot, assaulting enemy faction camps, destroying
        enemy faction rooms to find loot, kidnapping members of hositle factions, and so on.
